# Match-A-Genome
An interactive, beginner-friendly game to explore DNA, RNA, and protein sequence alignment â€” built as a final project for Stanfordâ€™s Code in Place 2025.
As part of Stanford Universityâ€™s Code in Place 2025 course, I developed "Match-A-Genome" as my final project â€” a small, beginner-friendly game designed to introduce fundamental bioinformatics concepts through interactive learning.

The game focuses on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), a core technique in genomics used to compare DNA, RNA, or protein sequences by inserting gaps so that similar regions align. While professional MSA tools rely on complex algorithms and scoring systems, Match-A-Genome offers a simplified, visual version to help learners grasp the basic idea in a hands-on way!

Here's how how it works:

ðŸ§¬ Players choose between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences

ðŸ§¬ Each selection generates random sequences for that session

ðŸ§¬ Players insert gaps to align sequences so matching letters line up vertically

ðŸ§¬ Correctly aligned positions are highlighted, and each match earns 1 point


This simple scoring system offers instant feedback, making the experience both educational and engaging.
With Python at its core, I created Match-A-Genome to bring together coding and biology in a playful way helping beginners explore bioinformatics through STEM-based game design.
